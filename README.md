# Advanced Machine Learning - Final Project Submission

**Name:** Akshaia Sai Diwakar. H
**Roll Number:** 2303717674421004

## Project Overview

This submission contains two case studies on applying advanced machine learning, presented as executable Jupyter Notebooks:
1.  **Document Authenticity Detection:** A CNN with Transfer Learning is trained to classify document images as real or fake.
2.  **Financial Stock Prediction:** A model combining FinBERT for sentiment analysis and an LSTM for time-series data is trained to predict stock price direction.

## How to Run the Notebooks

### Prerequisites
It is recommended to use Python 3.11. All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

First, set up the environment:
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment if you haven't already
# python3.11 -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
